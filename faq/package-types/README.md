# Package Types

sfpowerscripts is a build system for package-based development. In a package based development model, your org is split into composable packages with each package providing a distinct lifecycle.

Salesforce provides a lot of material to get you started on packaging. Here are some of the links if you are new to packaging

* [Adopting Package Based Development Model](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/adopting-package-based-development-model-salesforce-azlam-abdulsalam/?trk=read_related_article-card_title)

sfpowerscripts provides you commands to build and deploy packages in parallel. In addition to unlocked packages, sfpowerscripts support [source packages](source-packages.md) and [data packages](data-packages.md)
