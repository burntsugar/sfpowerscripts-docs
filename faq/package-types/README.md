# Package Types

sfpowerscripts is a build system for modular salesforce development. In a modular development model, your org is split into composable packages with each package providing a distinct lifecycle.

Salesforce provides a lot of material to get you started on packaging. Here are some of the links if you are new to packaging

* [Salesforce Dev Guide to Packaging](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx\_dev.meta/sfdx\_dev/sfdx\_dev\_unlocked\_pkg\_intro.htm)
* [Organizing your code/config](https://docs.dxatscale.io/development-practices/modularizing-your-code-config)

sfpowerscripts provides you commands to build and deploy packages in parallel. In addition to unlocked packages, sfpowerscripts support [source packages](source-packages.md) and [data packages](data-packages.md)
