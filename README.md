## **Key Features**

* Utilises sfdx-project.json ([Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm)) as the source of truth for driving the build system, ensuring very low maintenance on projects and programs often dealing with multiple number of packages
* Builds packages in parallel by respecting dependencies
* Ability to selectively build changed packages in a [mono repo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)
* Ability to deploy only packages that are changed in repo
* Pooling commands to prepare a pool of scratch orgs with packages pre-installed for optimized Pull/Merge Request Validation
* Artifacts Driven, all create commands produce an artifact or operate on an artifact
* Integrate with any CI/CD system of choice
* All commands are enabled with [statsD](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/statsd/), for collecting metrics about your pipeline

## History

sfpowerscripts initially began life in the form of an [Azure Pipelines Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzlamSalam.sfpowerscripts) available through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) wrote by Azlam Abdulsalam as a personal project.

The project was then migrated to [Accenture Open Source Program](https://accenture.github.io) and a key component of Accenture DX@Scale initiative, a set of opinionated tool and practices for Enterprise Salesforce Development. The project was then revamped as a build system delivered as a CLI plugin
